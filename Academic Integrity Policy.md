|  | ## Carnegie Mellon University Systems Courses, Fall 2025: Academic Integrity Policy  The following policy applies to all courses based on the textbook [*Computer Systems: A Programmer's Approach*](https://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/) (CS:APP) taught at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). These include the following:  **Introduction to Computer Systems**  15-213, 15-513, and 14-513  All of these courses are subject to the [university policy on academic integrity.](https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html)Courses in CIT (14-513) are also subject to the [CIT policy on academic integrity.](https://engineering.cmu.edu/education/academic-policies/academic-integrity.html)This document describes policy issues specific to these courses.  All of these courses have adopted the same standards as to what constitutes an Academic Integrity Violation (AIV). As is noted in the section below titled “Enforcement,” there may be course-specific guidelines regarding the possible penalties when an infraction occurs. Consult the syllabus for your course to get further information on penalties.  ## Guiding Principles  Our policy is based on the following beliefs, gained through many years of experience: - Understanding the operation and implementation of computer systems is best learned by hands-on activities: writing, debugging, measuring, and exercising programs that expose the relevant system principles. - Developing programs from scratch, or with limited starting code, requires using design principles and logical thinking that are much deeper than can be gained by copying and modifying an existing implementation. Making use of unauthorized sources diminishes the educational value of an assignment. - Although teamwork and collaboration are important real-world skills, it is important to first gain the core competencies that enable individuals to serve as effective team members. These courses are designed to teach and assess these core competencies. Unauthorized collaboration diminishes the educational experience and the reliability of our assessments. Based on these principles, we provide the following guidelines on what forms of resource use, resource sharing, and collaboration are permitted in these course.  ## Exams  Each exam must be the sole work of the student taking it. No collaboration of any form is allowed on exams. Students may not discuss any aspect of any exam question with someone who has not yet taken the exam.  ## Labs and Other Assignments  ### While You Are Taking the Class  As a general principle, you may not obtain any information about an assignment from an unauthorized source. The following provide clarifications as to which sources are authorized, and which are not.  **Copying:**  - You **may** use material that we explicitly provide you for the assignment. No attribution is required. - You **may** use other course material, including lectures, Ed posts by the instructors, and material from the course website. For any such use involving code, you must provide clear attribution, indicating the source, and where the included material begins and ends. - You **may** use any material from the CS:APP book, any other course textbook, or the [CS:APP web site](https://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/). For any such use involving code, you must provide clear attribution, indicating the source, and where the included material begins and ends. - Beyond this, you **may not** obtain code or other solution information, either by copying, retyping, or looking at files or documents from any of the above-listed courses for this semester, or a previous semester. - You **may not** obtain code or other solution information from an unauthorized external source, including web pages, code repositories, AI tools, blog posts, etc.  **Searching:**  - You **may** search for or refer to general information, including the use of systems, networks, compilers, debuggers, profilers, and program libraries. - You **may not** search the Web for solutions or for any advice on how to solve an assignment, including AI tools.  **Reusing:**  - You **may** reuse elements of general knowledge from prior courses. For example, you may use existing code for a linked list or to process commandline arguments. For any such use involving code, you must provide clear attribution, indicating the source, and where the included material begins and ends. - If you have worked on one of the labs from CS:APP, either at CMU, at some other school, or on your own, please arrange a meeting with one of the instructors at the beginning of the term to devise a policy on which parts of your solutions you may use. *Reuse without explicit permission of an instructor, even if it's your own code, is forbidden*.  **Using other's code or documents:**  - You **may not** look at someone else's code (or other documents.) This includes one person looking at code and describing it to another. There is no notion of looking “too much,” since no looking is allowed at all. - You **may not** make use of any information about the labs posted online, except for the authorized sources listed above.  **Assistance:**  - You **may** get assistance on an assignment from the instructors, course staff, and university tutors. - You **may only** get high-level, strategic advice from others, including current and former students, and people external to the university. Forbidden forms of advice include: anything more detailed than a brief verbal description or block diagram, any kind of code or pseudo-code, explicit directions on how to assemble allowed blocks of code, and code-level debugging assistance.  ### From Now and Into the Future  As a general principle, you may not provide detailed help with an assignment to students this semester or in future semesters for any of the above-listed courses (unless you are serving as a teaching assistant or instructor for the course.) The following are clarifications about which forms of aid are authorized and which are not. Note that they apply to *all* of the above listed courses and *from now and into the indefinite future*.  **Sharing:**  You **may not** supply a copy of a file or document to an individual student or via a public channel, such as a blog post.  **Providing access:**  You **may not** have any of your solution files in unprotected directories or in unprotected code repositories, either by putting files in an unprotected location or by allowing protections to lapse. Be sure to store your work in protected directories, and log off when you leave an open cluster, to prevent others from copying your work. If you make use of a code repository, such as Github, make sure your work is kept private, even after you have left CMU.  **Coaching, Assisting, and Collaborating:**  - You **may not** provide electronic, verbal, or written descriptions of code or other solution information. - You **may** clarify ambiguities or vague points in class handouts or textbooks. - You **may** help others use the computer systems, networks, compilers, debuggers, profilers, code libraries, and other system facilities. - You **may** discuss and provide general, strategic advice about an assignment. Providing anything more detailed than a brief description or a block diagram is not allowed. Providing any kind of code or pseudo-code is not allowed. Providing explicit directions on how to assemble allowed blocks of code is forbidden. - You **may** provide suggestions of potential bugs based on high-level symptoms. Code-based debugging assistance is forbidden.  ### AI Tools  AI Tools are a valuable tool for supporting both novices and experts. However, their usage can easily lead students into violating the above rules, especially as those tools may be trained using sources that would be disallowed to directly be used. If you do use an AI Tool, you should confine your interaction along the same rules as other external sources, such as only having high-level discussions and making sure to cite and document your usage.  In brief, students should avoid any copy-paste interactions with AI Tools, and cite what they do.  You **may not** upload the code you write for a lab assignment (or even parts of it) to any AI tool (cloud-based or locally hosted or in your IDE) nor give the AI tool access to the code (or even parts of it). Much like asking a friend for help and providing access to your code, the help you get is most likely going to be an AIV, so it is not permitted. Examples of AI Tools include ChatGPT, github copilot, Gemini, Claude, and many others.  ## Enforcement  We will aggressively employ cheat checkers and other means to detect unauthorized use of code from this term, previous terms, and available online. All infractions will lead to formal reporting of an AIV to the university and to the program. The standard penalty will be to be given a failing grade for the course. Lesser penalties may occur, depending on the nature of the infraction. **Consult the syllabus for your course for any additional information regarding penalties.**  ## No Statute of Limitations  The above stated rules apply even after your have completed the course. You may not share code you have written for this course with future students. That means you cannot leave your code in unprotected repositories or post it on any web page. You may not provide coaching to future students. We can and will file AIV reports for students who have already completed the course, possibly changing their grades.  ## "Regrets" Policy  Because we can all make bad decisions under the crunch of a deadline, we offer a "regrets" policy, which works as follows.  A student **may** email a course instructor with a request to withdraw a submitted assignment, even after the assignment deadline. The email request must be received by the instructor before any instructor or TA has discovered a potential AIV for the assignment. The submitted work will be deleted from autolab/canvas (no questions asked), the student will receive a 0 on the assignment, and no AIV will be filed. |
